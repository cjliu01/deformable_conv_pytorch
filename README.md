# deformable_conv_v2 in PyTorch

---



This repo has been reproduced **Deformable ConvNets v2 (Modulation deform conv) paper**: [Deformable ConvNets v2: More Deformable, Better Results](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11168) in Pytorch.

This implementation of deform_conv based on [4uiiurz1/pytorch-deform-conv-v2](https://github.com/4uiiurz1/pytorch-deform-conv-v2)ï¼Œ[ChunhuanLin/deform_conv_pytorch](https://github.com/ChunhuanLin/deform_conv_pytorch).Thanks for their good work!
